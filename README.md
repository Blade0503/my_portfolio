# Blade's Portfolio 🧱🔥

This is my personal developer portfolio site — a work in progress and a journey from noob to pro 😎  
Built from scratch with passion, pixels, and maybe a little chaos.

## 📂 Versions

This repo includes older versions to track my growth:

- **v1** – First ever version: HTML-only, everything in one file
- **v2** – External CSS added, minor design tweaks
- **v3** – Color theme switched to Charcoal + Icy Grey
- **v4** – Cleaned up layout, improved About Me section

## 📍 Current Version

The latest polished version can be found in the `current/` folder.  
Will keep updating it as I learn and experiment with more features.

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Google Fonts (Baloo Bhai)
- A ton of curiosity

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

I'm still learning, so don't judge me too hard 😭  
But if you're here for inspiration or collab, you're always welcome!
